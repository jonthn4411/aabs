Don't forget to enable the config of 'insteadof'

[url "ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/android/"]
	insteadOf = git://android.git.kernel.org/

1) Refer to the "Steps to Enter Release Cycle 2/3"
   described in Page 13 of "Android_Release_Cycle_Proposal"

-- repo init -u xxxx -b ...

-- copy a manifest.xml from a autobuild kit which you want to derive from
       to .repo/manifests/
   repo init -m manifest.xml
   repo sync

-- 
. traditional mode (to create a new branch for manifests.git)
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? multiple
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? multiple actual-run
. use the unique branch at manifest.git
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? unique
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? unique actual-run

-- change the local repo
. traditional mode
   repo init -b rls_xxxx_yyyy_a/b/r*?
. unique mode
   repo init -m axx/bxx/r*.xml
   repo sync

--- create the same branch for aabs
   cd workspace/aabs
   git fetch
   git chechout ...
   git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc

2) Create the files required by autobuild server that,
LAST_MS1.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? (for previous release)
LAST_MS2.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? (for master)
LAST_REL.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc?

   then
   a. upload them by self
      login buildfarm:marvell00@10.38.164.28 (publish server -- buildfarm6)
      put them into /autobuild/android/$PRODUCT/

   b. ask Shaohua Gu (shhgu@marvell.com)
            (Previously,
            (Joyce Zhang, joycezhang.marvell@manpower.com.cn)
            (Calm, calmshao.marvell@manpower.com.cn)
            (Rosalind, rosalind.marvell@manpower.com.cn)
            (Tony.Jiang) to upload it.

3) Add new platform build plans

  Append 2 lines to script.xml

  at
  \\tcms\BuildFram\
  or
  buildfarm:buildfarm@tcms:/opt/TestManager/source/release/WebContent/js/exec/exec_pie/data

  for example:
  <scripts> <name> $PRODUCT-$RELEASE-$BRANCH-formal </name> <script> $PRODUCT-$RELEASE-$BRANCH-formal.sh </script> </scripts>
  <scripts> <name> $PRODUCT-$RELEASE-$BRANCH </name> <script> $PRODUCT-$RELEASE-$BRANCH.sh </script> </scripts>

4) Set daily build by TCMS

  Create and save a task with daily recurrence type

5) Broadcast a mail to announce this new branch created

Here is the list for mmp2 branches.
