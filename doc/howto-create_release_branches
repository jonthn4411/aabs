-- copy a manifest.xml from a autobuild kit which you want to derive from
       to .repo/manifests/
   repo init -m manifest.xml
   repo sync

-- 
. traditional mode (to create a new branch for manifests.git)
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc?
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? actual-run
. use the unique branch at manifest.git
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? unique
   rls_branch.sh create rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? unique actual-run

-- change the local repo
. traditional mode
   repo init -b rls_xxxx_yyyy_a/b/r*?
. unique mode
   repo init -m axx/bxx/r*.xml
   repo sync

--- create the same branch for aabs
   cd workspace/aabs
   git fetch
   git chechout ...
   git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc

2) Create the files required by autobuild server that,
LAST_MS1.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? (for previous release)
LAST_MS2.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc? (for master)
LAST_REL.rls_xxxx_yyyy_alpha/beta/rc?
