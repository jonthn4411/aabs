How to get the 'latest' source code from git server
=====================================
  1. $ mkdir <android_working_dir>
     $ cd <android_working_dir>

  2. For Gingerbread
     $ repo init -u ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/android/platform/manifest.git -b abilene-gingerbread
     For Honeycomb
     $ repo init -u ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/droid/platform/manifest.git -b abilene-honeycomb

  3. $ repo sync

  You may don't have the access to our git server. In this situation, contact the administrator of our git server.

How to get the code that the autobuild system uses for daily build and code drop
=====================================
-Method I
  1. $ mkdir <android_working_dir>
     $ cd <android_working_dir>

  2. For Gingerbread
     $ repo init -u ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/android/platform/manifest.git -b abilene-gingerbread
     For Honeycomb
     $ repo init -u ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/droid/platform/manifest.git -b abilene-honeycomb
     You may don't have the access to our git server. In this situation, contact the administrator of our git server.

  3. copy 'manifest.xml' from autobuild system or code drop into my_droid_src/.repo/manifests/, name it as whatever you like, say 'my_manifest.xml'.

  4. In <android_working_dir>, run repo-init again as below
     $ repo init -m 'my_manifest.xml' # Don't need the full path of my_manifest.xml

  5. $ repo sync

-Method II
  1. Find out 'droid_all_src.tgz' in the daily build or code drop.

  2. Extract that tgz package as below.
     $ tar xzvf droid_all_src.tgz

  3. $ cd source # now you're in the source root.

How to Build Uboot
=====================================
  1. Go to the diretory <android_working_dir>/boot
     $ cd <android_working_dir>/boot  # replace my_droid_src by the actual android source root on your machine

  2. Make uboot
     $ make all

How to Build kernel and android image
=====================================
  1. build kernel and modules
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ cd kernel
     $ make all

  uImage is located at kernel/out, modules is located at kernel/out/modules

  2. build android
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ source build/envsetup.sh
     $ chooseproduct abilene
     $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=kernel/out/modules
     $ make

  The android ramdisk.img, system.img and userdata.img are located at out/target/product/abilene

Burning OBM and Uboot
=====================
1. Install the latest XDB with version 5.1
2. Get the boot binaries (uboot & obm) from autobuild server
3. Flash OBM and U-boot into EMMC using XDB
   1)Use flash burn tool: flash --> burn flash
   2)Choose flash: NAND Flash
   3)Erase All Blocks to erase the nand autoboot obm
   4)Choose flash: EMMC flash and click Detect button to detect emmc partition
   5)Choose partition 0x1
      d)Burn "ntim_mmp3_v7_mp_emmc_dis_uboot.bin"       address [0x000000]
            ("ntim_mmp3_v7_mp_emmc_pop_uboot.bin" for pop board, CPU frequence 200M Hz)
            ("ntim_mmp3_v7_mp_emmc_dis_uboot.bin" for dis board, CPU frequence 200M Hz)
            ("ntim_mmp3_v7_mp_emmc_xxx_uboot_800.bin" for pop/dis board, CPU frequence 800M Hz)
            ("ntim_mmp3_v7_mp_emmc_xxx_uboot_1000.bin" for pop/dis board, CPU frequence 1G Hz)
      e)Burn "LoopSelf.bin"                             address [0x020000]
     Choose partition 0x2
      f)Burn "u-boot.bin"                               address [0x000000]
     Partition 0x0 can be burn in u-boot with mmc.

How to Disable GC2000
=====================
remove or rename egl.cfg which located in /system/lib/egl/

Boot up Android on eMMC
=====================================

Boot the device, and enter the uboot menu.

0) By default, the initial device is set to eMMC.
   You can run the following struction to make sure:
Abilene>> mfpch emmc

1) Partition table
Abilene>> tftpboot 0x1100000 primary_gpt_8g
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0 0x22
Abilene>> tftpboot 0x1100000 secondary_gpt_8g
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0xECBFDF 0x21 

Please ignore only the following error, since it's not an actual error.
----------error begins----------------
Wrong Image Format for tftpboot command
ERROR: can't get kernel image
----------error ends------------------

2) Kernel image
   uImage.android is the SMP kernel while uImage.up.android is the UP one.
Abilene>> tftp 0x1100000 uImage.up.android 
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0x4c00 0x4000

3) ramdisk
Abilene>> tftpboot 0x1100000 ramdisk_ext3.img
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0x8c00 0x4000

4) system
Abilene>> tftpboot 0x1100000 system_ext3_internal.img
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0xcc00 0x4b000

5) user data
Abilene>> tftpboot 0x1100000 userdata_ext3_internal.img
Abilene>> mmc write 0x1100000 0x57c00 0x4b000

After done, power-off and power-on again to boot mmp3 from emmc.
