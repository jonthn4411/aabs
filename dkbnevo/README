Use TFTP to erase or reburn specific binaries
=============================================
Setup Android on EMMC
===========================
1.Start your favorite terminal emulator with the appropriate 
	COM port set to 115200,8N1. Power on hte board and wait for NEVODKB>> prompt to appear

3.Enter the following command to upload the system.img into the RAM and burn into flash:
For EMMC, issue the following commands:
NEVODKB>>tftp primary_gpt
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x0 0x400

NEVODKB>>tftp zImage
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0xC400 0x2000

NEVODKB>>tftp system_ext3.img
NEVODKB>>unsparse 0x134C00 0x100000

NEVODKB>>tftp userdata_ext3.img
NEVODKB>>unsparse 0x234C00 0x600000

NEVODKB>>tftp ramdisk.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0xE400 0x800

NEVODKB>>tftp pxafs_ext4.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x120C00 0x6000

NEVODKB>>tftp secondary_gpt
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x1D4FFDF 0x21
(if eMMC size is 8G
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0xE8FFDF 0x21
check eMMC size by "mmcinfo" command in uboot
)

Reboot the system.


Note 1: All the following images should copy to the host tftp share directory:
	zImage
	system_ext3.img
	userdata_ext3.img
	ramdisk.img
        pxafs_ext4.img
        primary_gpt
        secondary_gpt

Note 2: You need to first input "sw" to switch to usb eth, and then, input "tftp zImage", then connect the USB micro-line between the host PC and the dkbnevo board
Note 3: You need to configure the host network interface:
	# ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100 

Setup Android on NFS
===========================
1)  Burn all images except for ramdisk.img. [zImage.android.mmc can be used]
2)  Setup nfs on host. Host ip is 192.168.1.100 and android rootfs should be put to /nfs/android
3)  unzip root_nfs_internal.tgz to /nfs/android
4)  reboot

+Kernel failed to bootup
----------------------------------------------------------------
Update your obm/uboot image and try again.


+How to disable GC860 completly
----------------------------------------------------------------
You can do this by: rm /system/lib/egl/egl.cfg, so android UI and 3D applications will use SW version instead of GC860. To save 16MB from GC860 low level driver, you can: rm /system/lib/modules/galcore.ko
