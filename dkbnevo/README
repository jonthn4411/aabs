        Press "start" button (the button with the green bulb icon), wait for the icon become red color.

        ntim_nand.bin                                           --> flash address 0x00000 (this binary is automatically created by SoftwareDownloader, when press "start" button)

3) Connect the USB cable between the host machine and the board.
4) Power on the board, hold "Back" button on the board, and Press the reset key on the board, Release the "Back" button after the software download shows the downloading is in progress. When the burning is done, the software download will pop up a dialog to notify
Notes: you will be asked to install usb driver if it's your first time to burn the board, then install the driver in <softwareDownloader>/WTPTP folder.

Burn binaries by XDB
============================
Burn following binaries to EMMC using Marvell eXtreme Debugger 5.3
Use the configuration file c:\program files\marvell\xdb5.3\xdb\configurations\jtag\soc\pxa978\pxa978_c0_cs.xsf
Configuration:CPU-JTAG->Target Connection: (usb:).
    "Burning"
        - Board:PXA978
        - Flash:eMMC Flash
        - Burn as binary File
        - Erase affected blocks
    "Erasing/Unblocking"
        - Block Selection: all blocks -> Erase

Choose partition 1
	NEVO_EVB_TOBM_EMMCAB_MODE3.bin.rnd	--> address 0x00000
Choose partition 0
	u-boot.bin				--> address 0x140000
	Arbel_DIGRF3.bin			--> address 0x200000
	TTD_M06_AI_A1_Flash.bin			--> address 0x700000
	TTD_M06_AI_A1_L2_I_RAM_SECOND_Flash.bin	--> address 0x900000

Use TFTP to erase or reburn specific binaries
=============================================
Setup Android on EMMC
===========================
1.Start your favorite terminal emulator with the appropriate 
	COM port set to 115200,8N1. Power on hte board and wait for NEVODKB>> prompt to appear

3.Enter the following command to upload the system.img into the RAM and burn into flash:
For EMMC, issue the following commands:
NEVODKB>>tftp primary_gpt
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x0 0x400

NEVODKB>>tftp zImage
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x5000 0x2000

NEVODKB>>tftp system_ext3.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x40800 0x50000

NEVODKB>>tftp userdata_ext3.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0xC0800 0x21C00

NEVODKB>>tftp ramdisk.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x7000 0x200

NEVODKB>>tftp pxafs_ext4.img
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x14000 0x4000

NEVODKB>>tftp secondary_gpt
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0x1D4FFDF 0x21
(if eMMC size is 8G
NEVODKB>>mmc write 0xE8FFDF 0x21
check eMMC size by "mmcinfo" command in uboot
)

Reboot the system.


Note 1: All the following images should copy to the host tftp share directory:
	zImage
	system_ext3.img
	userdata_ext3.img
	ramdisk.img
        pxafs_ext4.img
        primary_gpt
        secondary_gpt

Note 2: You need to first input "sw" to switch to usb eth, and then, input "tftp zImage", then connect the USB micro-line between the host PC and the dkbnevo board
Note 3: You need to configure the host network interface:
	# ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100 

Setup Android on NFS
===========================
1)  Burn all images except for ramdisk.img. [zImage.android.mmc can be used]
2)  Setup nfs on host. Host ip is 192.168.1.100 and android rootfs should be put to /nfs/android
3)  unzip root_nfs_internal.tgz to /nfs/android
4)  reboot

+Kernel failed to bootup
----------------------------------------------------------------
Update your obm/uboot image and try again.


+How to disable GC860 completly
----------------------------------------------------------------
You can do this by: rm /system/lib/egl/egl.cfg, so android UI and 3D applications will use SW version instead of GC860. To save 16MB from GC860 low level driver, you can: rm /system/lib/modules/galcore.ko
