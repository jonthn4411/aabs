3. Usage of this package 
3.1 Install this package
3.1.1 Download the Marvell packages:
----PXA978_Android_Platform_<VERSION>_src.tgz  
----PXA978_Android_Platform_<VERSION>_prebuilt_bin
3.1.2 Type the following command to install:
 $ mkdir [installed_directory]
 $ cd [installed_directory]
 $ tar -xvzf [The PATH you downloaded Marvell Packages]/PXA978_Android_Platform_<VERSION>_src.tgz

3.2 Setup Android directory
 intall repo, and make it runnable(curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo)
 $ mkdir [android_dir]
 $ cd [android_dir]
 $ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b master
 $ cp [installed_directory]/src/marvell_manifest.xml .repo/manifests/
 $ repo init -m marvell_manifest.xml
 $ repo sync
 $ cd [installed_directory]/src
 $ ./setup_android.sh [android_dir]
 If you use the iAnywhere Bluetook stack instead of BlueZ in Android, apply the iAnywhere patches and BlueZ will be removed. Or skip following three steps.
 $ tar xvf rls_ianywhere_<VERSION>.tgz
 $ cd rls_ianywhere_<VERSION>/installdir
 $ ./patch_ianywhere.sh [android_dir]

3.3 Building Android,Linux Kernel,Uboot and OBM
3.3.1 Build Linux Kernel
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ make kernel
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/zImage

3.3.2 Build Modules
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ make modules
Note: Please make kernel before making modules
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/modules

3.3.3 Buid PXA Android by:
 $ cd [android_dir]
 $ . build/envsetup.sh
 $ chooseproduct nevo
 $ make -j4
Note: The binaries will be generated under src/android/out/target/product/nevo/.
Note: Currently we use Android default toolchain to compile Android, kernel and telephony. After you run choosecombo, you can check your PATH setting and make sure it has included the path for google arm-eabi toolchain. Please donot pecify other android toolchain version. 

3.3.4 Building telephony
$ cd [android_dir]/kernel
$ make telephony
Note: Please make android before making telephony

3.3.5 Building uboot
 $ cd [android_dir]/boot
 $ make uboot
After a short while, the binary will be generated under [android]/boot/out/u-boot.bin
Notes: kernel should be built before uboot as uboot will get cmd info from kernel config

3.3.6 Building OBM
 $ cd [android_dir]/boot
 $ make all
After a short while, the binary will be generated under [android]/boot/out/
