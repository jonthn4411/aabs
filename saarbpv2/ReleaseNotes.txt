3.3 Building Android,Linux Kernel,Uboot and OBM

3.3.1 Build Linux Kernel
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ make kernel
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/zImage

3.3.2 Build Modules
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ make modules
Note: Please make kernel before making modules
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/modules

3.3.3 Buid PXA Android by:
 $ cd [android_dir]
 $ . build/envsetup.sh
 $ chooseproduct saarbpv2
 $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=[android_dir]/kernel/out/modules
 $ make -j4
Note: If there is no modules, Please export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=no_kernel_modules
Note: The binaries will be generated under src/android/out/target/product/saarbpv2/.
Note: Currently we use Android default toolchain to compile Android, kernel and telephony. After you run choosecombo, you can check your PATH setting and make sure it has included the path for google arm-eabi toolchain. Please donot pecify other android toolchain version.
