3.3 Building Android,Linux Kernel,Uboot

3.3.1 Build Linux Kernel
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ sudo make kernel
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/zImage

3.3.2 Build Modules
 $ cd [android_dir]/kernel
 $ sudo make modules
Note: Please make kernel before making modules
After a short while, the binaries will be generated under [android]/kernel/out/modules

3.3.3 Buid PXA Android by:
 $ cd [android_dir]
 $ . build/envsetup.sh
 $ chooseproduct saarbpv2
 $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=[android]/kernel/out/modules
 $ make -j4
Note : If there is no modules, Please export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=no_kernel_modules
After a while (30~60 minutes), the binaries will be generated under [android_dir]/out/target/product/evbpv2/.
Note: Currently we use Android default toolchain version: arm-eabi-4.2.1 to compile Android, kernel and telephony. After you run choosecombo, you can check your PATH setting and make sure it has included the path for arm-eabi-4.2.1. Please donot pecify other android toolchain version. 

3.3.4 Building uboot
 $ cd [android_dir]/boot
 $ make uboot
After a short while, the binary will be generated under [android]/boot/out/u-boot.bin

3.4 Flashing images and boot system (128MB is set as default)
3.4.1 Burn following binaries to flash by using the Marvell eXtreme Debugger.
	TAVOR_SAAR_PV_NTOBM_ONENAND_MODE1.bin		--> flash address 0x00000
	u-boot.bin					--> flash address 0x80000

3.4.2 Start your favorite terminal emulator with the appropriate 
      COM port set to 115200,8N1. Power on the board and wait for TavorPV2>> prompt to appear

3.4.3 Enter the following command to upload the kernel into the RAM and burn into flash:
For OneNAND flash, issue the following commands:
TavorPV2>>tftp zImage
TavorPV2>>onenand erase 0x920000 0x300000
TavorPV2>>onenand write 0x80800000 0x920000 0x300000

Note 1: You need to configure the host network interface:
   # ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100 (for USB)
   # ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 (for Ethernet)
Note 2: uboot configures ethernet download as default. please use TavorPV2>> sw to switch to USB 

3.4.4 Enter the following command to upload the system.img into the RAM and burn into flash:
For OneNAND flash, issue the following commands:
TavorPV2>>tftp system.img
TavorPV2>>onenand erase 0x0c20000 0x7000000
TavorPV2>onenand write.yaffs 0x80800000 0x0c20000 <actual-image-size>(Note: ony hex supported)

3.4.5 Enter the following command to upload the userata.img into the RAM and burn into flash:
For OneNAND flash, issue the following commands:
TavorPV2>>tftp userdata.img
TavorPV2>>onenand erase 0x7c20000 0x7000000
TavorPV2>>onenand write.yaffs 0x80800000 0x7c20000 <actual-image-size>(Note: ony hex supported)

3.4.6 Enter the following command to upload the ramdisk.img into the RAM and burn into flash:
For OneNAND flash, issue the following commands:
TavorPV2>>tftp ramdisk.img
TavorPV2>>onenand erase 0xc0000 0x40000
TavorPV2>>onenand write 0x80800000 0xc0000 0x40000
