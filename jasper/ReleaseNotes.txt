4. Use the patch-based source code 
==================================

4.1 Setup Android working directory
  

  First, please go to http://source.android.com to download the "repo" tool and setup the build environment for Android.


  Second, create the android working directory and download the initial code base.
    $ mkdir <android_working_dir>
	 
    $ cd <android_working_dir>
	 
    $ repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest -b master
	 
    $ repo sync

  
  Third, switch the code base specified by marvell_manifest.xml
	 
    $ cp <installed_source_dir>/marvell_manifest.xml .repo/manifest/
     
    $ repo init -m marvell_manifest.xml
     
    $ repo sync

  
  Last, apply marvell patches
     
    $ cd <installed_source_dir>
     
    $ ./setup_android.sh <android_working_dir>


4.2 Building the source code
4.2.1 Build Android by:
  First, edit vendor/marvell/jasper/BoardConfig.mk to set BOARD_ENABLE_HELIX to false as helix is not released in this package.
  Second, type as below:
  $ cd <android_working_dir>
  $ . build/envsetup.sh
  $ chooseproduct jasper
  $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=no_kernel_modules
  $ make -j4

  Note: 
  
    Since we haven't built the kernel, there are no kernel modules. While building kernel requires root directory which is generated by building Android.


4.2.2 Build kernel and modules
  $ cd <android_working_dir>
  $ cp -p -r out/target/product/avlite/root kernel/kernel/
  
  $ cd kernel
  
  $make all
  
  
  Notes:
  
    The zImage locates at kernel/out/



4.2.3 Rebuild Android
  
  $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=kernel/out/modules/
  
  $ make -j4
  
  Notes:
  
    The mbr and android ramdisk_ext2.img system_ext2.img and userdata_ext2.img locate at out/target/product/jasper
