How to get source code from git server
=====================================
  1. repo init -u ssh://shgit.marvell.com/git/android/platform/manifest -b <branch-name>
  2. repo sync

  <branch-name> : for example brownstone-froyo

How to build kernel and android image
=====================================
  1. build kernel and modules
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ cd kernel
     $ make all

  zImage is located at kernel/out, modules is located at kernel/out/modules

  2. build android
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ . build/envsetup.sh
     $ chooseproduct brownstone
     $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=kernel/out/modules
     $ make

  The android GPTs, ramdisk.img, system_ext4.img and userdata_ext4.img are located at out/target/product/brownstone

  3. build uboot and obm
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ cd boot
     $ make all

  The uboot bin is located at boot/out, nand auto boot version obm is located at boot/out/nand, emmc auto boot version obm is located at boot/out/emmc

Burning OBM and UBoot
=====================
1. Install XDB 5.0 Gold from: \\sh1sbak009\debugger_public\Official_Release\eXtreme_Debugger_v5.0_Gold
2. After getting nand or emmc version binary from autobuild server, please follow either step 3 or 4 to bring up board
3. Flash OBM and U-boot into NAND using XDB
   1)Use flash burn tool: flash --> burn flash
   2)Initialize a new flash and Erase all blocks
   3)burn file "ntim_mmp2_nand_bbu_ddr.bin"  		address --> 0x0
   4)burn file "MMP2_NTLOADER_3_2_17.bin"               address --> 0x80000
   5)burn file "Wtm_rel_mmp2.bin"		        address --> 0xc0000

4. Flash OBM and U-boot into EMMC using XDB
   1)Use flash burn tool: flash --> burn flash
   2)Choose flash: NAND Flash
   3)Erase All Blocks to erase the nand autoboot obm
   4)Choose flash: EMMC flash and click Detect button to detect emmc partition
   5)Choose partition 0x1
      a)Burn file "ntim_mmp2_nand_bbu_ddr.bin"		address --> 0x0
      b)Burn file "partition.bin"			address --> 0x600

      e)burn file "u-boot.bin"				address --> 0x52000

How to Disable GC800
=====================
remove or rename egl.cfg which located in /system/lib/egl/


Setup Android on NAND(emmc)
=========================

Boot the device with console, and then flash the images via uboot

1) By default, the initial sw part has been set to 0.
   Alternatively, you can run the following struction to make sure.
MMP2>> mmc sw_part 0

2) GPT
MMP2>> t primary_gpt_8g
MMP2>> mmc write 0 0x22 0x1100000
MMP2>> t secondary_gpt_8g
MMP2>> mmc write 0xecafdf 0x21 0x1100000

3) kernel
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> mmc write 0x4c00 0x2000 0x1100000

4) ramdisk
MMP2>> t ramdisk.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0x8c00 0x800 0x1100000

5) system
MMP2>> t system_ext4.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0xcc00 0x4b000 0x1100000

6) data
MMP2>> t userdata_ext4.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0x57c00 0x4b000 0x1100000

7) recovery

MMP2>> t zImage_recovery.android
MMP2>> mmc write 0xa2c00 0x2000 0x1100000
MMP2>> t ramdisk_recovery.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0xa6c00 0x800 0x1100000
MMP2>> t cache_ext4.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0xab000 0x4b000 0x1100000

After done, power-off and power-on again to boot mmp2 from emmc.

Setup Android on SD Card
========================
Follow the below process to make a SD card with Android root file system installed.
1) Plug a SD card to the PC
2) mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc #your SD card maybe mounted at the other sd device, such as /dev/sdb
3) mount /dev/sdc /mnt/disk
4) tar xvf root_nfs.tgz /tmp; cp -p -r /tmp/root_nfs/* /mnt/disk/;
5) umount /dev/sdc

Second, burning the zImage.android.mmc image.
Boot the device with console,
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> mmc write 0x4c00 0x2000 0x1100000

Note : erase ramdisk first if you want to boot from sdcard


Setup Android on NFS
====================
1) Install the NFS server on PC host.
2) mkdir /nfs and /nfs/android
3) add the below line to /etc/exports
  /nfs/android            *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
  Notes: be sure you specify all the optional paramters above.
4) tar xvf root_nfs.tgz /tmp/
5) mv /tmp/root_nfs/* /nfs/android
6) sudo exportfs -r

Last, you should use zImage to boot the kernel and then set the bootargs variable in UBoot.
(Notes:if adb is enabled in the kernel, this way doesn't work as the usb net won't work as the usb is used for adb)
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> bo

Note : erase ramdisk first if you want to boot from sdcard

Notes:we used one kernel binary solution, the boot sequence is nand --> mmc --> nfs, now nand is not supported, so remove sdcard first if you want to boot from nfs. And the nfs server is fixed as 192.168.1.100:/nfs/android. if you want to change it, modify vendor/marvell/brownstone/roodir/rdinit and build the kernel again

Notes:You only need use setenv and savenv command one time. Next time UBoot will load the environment variable from NAND automaticllay. But later if you want use zImage.android.mmc to boot Android from SD card, you should clear the "bootargs" environment variable. You can do this by:



Known Issues about running Android on NFS
=========================================
+ Wifi can't be enabled if you are using UBuntu9.04 or higher
-------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: When you enabled the Wifi, use the logcat you can see a message "Error changing group ownership of wpa_supplicant.conf to 1001:Operation not permitted." This only happens if your host PC is running with UBuntu9.04. We tested UBuntu8.04 and UBuntu8.10, which doesn't have this issue.
  Reason: We don't know the exact reason why chown doesn't work on UBuntu9.04 but works on 8.04 or 8.10.

  Workaround:In the console, you can copy the wpa_supplicant.conf from /system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf to /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf and chmod 777 wpa_supplicant.conf.


+ Calibration data can't be saved, any setting data can't be saved.
------------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: You calibrate the touch screen with Calibration app, and the screen works well. But at next boot, you have to calibrate it again. The calibration data isn't stored. 

  Reason: Actually the calibration data is saved to persistent property file. But just fail to read it from persistent property at boot. This seems a limitation of NFS file system on support opendir() function.

  Workaround: no workaround is available right now, just recalibrate it.


+Media on SD Card can't be seen by Video/Music/Photo App
------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: Plug the SD card to device, with media files on SD card, but Video/Music/Photo App can't see anything.
  Reason: Mounting SD card is disabled in root_nfs.tgz on purpose. As if Android is running on SD card, enable mounting of SD card may cause confliction. So by default we disable it in root_nfs.tgz. 
  Workaround:You can enable it manually by edit /system/etc/vold.conf, uncomment the section of volume_sdcard.

FAQ
=====
+How can I configure video output path?
---------------------------------------------------------------
The opencore,GStreamer and Helix engine uses the property video.accelerate.hw to determine the video output path.
If the property is set to 'gc', it will allocate memory from PMEM and expect GC to do color conversion.
If the property is set to 'overlay', it will use the overlay engine to output the video.
If it is other values, it will use software color conversion and let surfaceflinger to output the video frame.

+How to modify the files after the system_xxx.img has been burned to the flash?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please remount the system partition with rw mode by
$adb remount

+How to enable the video playback profiling?
--------------------------------------------
After the android boot up, type in console:
$setprop enable.pvplayer.profiling 1
$logcat &

While playback a video clip, the profiling data will be output to console.

+How to enable the fake ac and battery status?
----------------------------------------------
If the battery service reports wrong battery status, Android power off the system automatically. You can use the below way to request battery service to report fake status to cheat android system.

Open /init.rc, add the below line before class_start default:
setprop battery.fake_ac true
