  2. repo sync

  <branch-name> : for example brownstone-froyo

How to build kernel and android image
=====================================
  1. build kernel and modules
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ cd kernel
     $ make all

  zImage is located at kernel/out, modules is located at kernel/out/modules

  2. build android
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ . build/envsetup.sh
     $ chooseproduct jasper
     $ export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=kernel/out/modules
     $ make

  The android mbr, ramdisk_ext3.img, system_ext3.img and userdata_ext3.img are located at out/target/product/jasper

  3. build uboot and obm
     $ cd <android_working_dir>
     $ cd boot
     $ make all

  The uboot bin is located at boot/out, nand auto boot version obm is located at boot/out/nand, emmc auto boot version obm is located at boot/out/emmc

Install Helix Libraries
=======================
. Android is running from SD card
  a) plug the SD card to a PC

How to Disable GC800
=====================
remove or rename egl.cfg which located in /system/lib/egl/


Setup Android on NAND(emmc)
=========================

Boot the device with console

first burn zImage, ensure choose mmc paritition 0
MMP2>> mmc sw_part 0             // if you see "switch to partition #0, OK", then switch is ok
MMP2>> sw
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> mmc write 0x4c00 0x2000 0x1100000

sencond, burning mbr, ramdisk, system and userdata img
MMP2>> t mbr
MMP2>> mmc write 0x4800 0x1 0x1100000
MMP2>> t ramdisk_ext3.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0x8C00 0x4000 0x1100000
MMP2>> t system_ext3.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0xCC00 0x3C000 0x1100000
MMP2>> t userdata_ext3.img
MMP2>> mmc write 0x48C00 0x4B000 0x1100000 

when you done, power off mmp2, and power again to boot it from emmc.
Note : Reboot is not workable, remember to mmc sw_part 0 before boot.

Setup Android on SD Card
========================
Follow the below process to make a SD card with Android root file system installed.
1) Plug a SD card to the PC
2) mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdc #your SD card maybe mounted at the other sd device, such as /dev/sdb
3) mount /dev/sdc /mnt/disk
4) tar xvf root_nfs.tgz /tmp; cp -p -r /tmp/root_nfs/* /mnt/disk/;
5) umount /dev/sdc

Second, burning the zImage.android.mmc image.
Boot the device with console,
MMP2>> sw         // Set the interface to u2o-eth
MMP2>> mmc sw_part 0
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> mmc write 0x4c00 0x2000 0x1100000

Note : erase ramdisk first if you want to boot from sdcard


Setup Android on NFS
====================
1) Installed the NFS server on PC host.
2) mkdir /nfs and /nfs/android
3) add below line to /etc/exports
  /nfs/android            *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
  Notes: be sure you specify all the optional paramters above.
4) tar xvf root_nfs.tgz /tmp/
5) mv /tmp/root_nfs/* /nfs/android

Last, you should use zImage to boot the kernel and then set the bootargs variable in UBoot.
(Notes:if adb is enabled in the kernel, this way doesn't work as the usb net won't work as the usb is used for adb)
MMP2>> sw
MMP2>> mmc sw_part 0
MMP2>> t zImage.android
MMP2>> bo

Note : erase ramdisk first if you want to boot from sdcard

Notes:we used one kernel binary solution, the boot sequence is nand --> mmc --> nfs, now nand is not supported, so remove sdcard first if you want to boot from nfs. And the nfs server is fixed as 192.168.1.100:/nfs/android. if you want to change it, modify vendor/marvell/jasper/roodir/rdinit and build the kernel again

Notes:You only need use setenv and savenv command one time. Next time UBoot will load the environment variable from NAND automaticllay. But later if you want use zImage.android.mmc to boot Android from SD card, you should clear the "bootargs" environment variable. You can do this by:



Known Issues about running Android on NFS
=========================================
+ Wifi can't be enabled if you are using UBuntu9.04 or higher
-------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: When you enabled the Wifi, use the logcat you can see a message "Error changing group ownership of wpa_supplicant.conf to 1001:Operation not permitted." This only happens if your host PC is running with UBuntu9.04. We tested UBuntu8.04 and UBuntu8.10, which doesn't have this issue.
  Reason: We don't know the exact reason why chown doesn't work on UBuntu9.04 but works on 8.04 or 8.10.

  Workaround:In the console, you can copy the wpa_supplicant.conf from /system/etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf to /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf and chmod 777 wpa_supplicant.conf.


+ Calibration data can't be saved, any setting data can't be saved.
------------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: You calibrate the touch screen with Calibration app, and the screen works well. But at next boot, you have to calibrate it again. The calibration data isn't stored. 

  Reason: Actually the calibration data is saved to persistent property file. But just fail to read it from persistent property at boot. This seems a limitation of NFS file system on support opendir() function.

  Workaround: no workaround is available right now, just recalibrate it.


+Media on SD Card can't be seen by Video/Music/Photo App
------------------------------------------------------------
  Symptom: Plug the SD card to device, with media files on SD card, but Video/Music/Photo App can't see anything.
  Reason: Mounting SD card is disabled in root_nfs.tgz on purpose. As if Android is running on SD card, enable mounting of SD card may cause confliction. So by default we disable it in root_nfs.tgz. 
  Workaround:You can enable it manually by edit /system/etc/vold.conf, uncomment the section of volume_sdcard.

FAQ
=====
+Wifi can't be enabled if I use a zImage built at the other day.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The wifi kernel module in root_nfs.tgz or system_ubi.img may not comply with zImages built at the other day. Please use the zImage and root_nfs.tgz or system_ubi.img built at the same day.


+How can I disable GC300 copybit engine completely?
---------------------------------------------------
You can do this by: rm /system/lib/hw/copybit.default.so, so that Android GUI system won't use GC300 copybit engine. 
But the built-in media playback engine will still try to use GC300 copybit engine to do resizing and color conversion. Check the topic "How can I disable GC300 copybit engine on video playback?".

+How can I configure video output path?
---------------------------------------------------------------
The opencore,GStreamer and Helix engine uses the property video.accelerate.hw to determine the video output path.
If the property is set to 'gc', it will allocate memory from PMEM and expect GC to do color conversion.
If the property is set to 'overlay', it will use the overlay engine to output the video.
If it is other values, it will use software color conversion and let surfaceflinger to output the video frame.

+How to modify the files after the system_ubi.img has been burned to the flash?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the console mode, you can remount the /system folder by
$mount -o remount -t ubifs ubi0_0 /system

+How to enable the video playback profiling?
--------------------------------------------
After the android boot up, type in console:
$setprop enable.pvplayer.profiling 1
$logcat &

While playback a video clip, the profiling data will be output to console.

+How to enable the fake ac and battery status?
----------------------------------------------
If the battery service reports wrong battery status, Android power off the system automatically. You can use the below way to request battery service to report fake status to cheat android system.

Open /init.rc, add the below line before class_start default:
setprop battery.fake_ac true
