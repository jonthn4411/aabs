If you want recovery to be functional, you have to burn the below images together:
        ramdisk-recovery.img                            --> flash address 0x1180000
        uImage-mt                                       --> flash address 0x0d80000 
        (Currently uImage-mt is same with uImage, so you can get a copy of uImage and rename to "uImage-mt")
        
You'd better make a clean erase of nand flash before burning.

Boot Android or enter different mode
=====================================
1) default. No key is pressed when power on, enter normal Android
2) HOME+POWER -->Enter Recovery Mode

      COM port set to 115200,8N1. Power on hte board and wait for TTC_DKB>> prompt to appear

2.Enter the following command to upload the kernel into the RAM and burn into flash:
For NAND flash, issue the following commands:
TTC_DKB>>nand erase 0x980000 0x349250
TTC_DKB>>tftp 0x1000000 uImage
TTC_DKB>>nand write 0x1000000 0x980000 0x349250
Note 1: All the following images should copy to the host tftp share directory:
	uImage
	system.img
	userdata.img
	pxafs.img
Note 2: You need to first input "sw" to switch to usb eth, and then, input "tftp 0x1000000 uImage", then connect the USB micro-line between the host PC and the dkbboard
Note 3: You need to configure the host network interface:
   # ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100
Note 4: If you want to boot from nand flash. You have to burn ramdisk. Otherwise if will boot from MMC or NFS
	You can burn ramdisk by tftp too.

Marvell Code Performance Analyzer Sample Guide
=============================================
This release supports the Marvell Code Performance Analyzer, version 2.3. Download this version from the Marvell Extranet website at http://www.marvell.com/extranet. If you do not have a Marvell Extranet user ID, click on the ¡°register¡± link at http://www.marvell.com and follow the instructions therein.
- Installation
Before running the data collector, go to the /system/bin/ folder and run the following command to load the kernel driver:
$ load_mpdc.sh
- Known Issues or Limitations
  - It is recommended to first turn off the Marvell Scalable Power Management (MSPM). Otherwise, the Marvell Performance Data Collector (mpdc) may not work normally. Use the following commands to turn off MSPM on your target:
echo 0 >/sys/power/mspm/mspm
  - When using the command line, if you get the error message "Fail to communicate with daemon:Success", reload your activity and run it to collect the result again.
  - When doing remote data collection on the Android target, if the analyzer exits abnormally, the status of the mpdc_svr may still be connected. If this happens, restart the mpdc_svr on the target.
  - If the samples/second value is set too large, the events/sample value is adjusted after a calibration to a smaller value, which makes the interrupt happen more frequently. If this happens, the system becomes busy and the mpdc stops after the expected duration is expired. In addition, most of the samples will be located on the process "mpdc_d". In this case, create your activity with a decreased samples/second value and start it. 
  - When using the command line, multiple activities cannot be started at the same time.
  - If you want to make mpdc_svr listen to another port through using the command "mpdc_svr -p <PortNumber>" on the Android target, a segmentation fault occurs.
  - Do not set OS_TIMER as the event in the Event-Based Sampling (EBS).
