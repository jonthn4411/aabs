5. Marvell Code Performance Analyzer
The Marvell Code Performance Analyzer v2.3 is supported in this release.

5.1 What's New
Call Stack sampling data collection and corresponding data analysis
Remote data collection via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for the Android device

5.2 Features
The following sections provide information about the supported and unsupported features for this release.
5.2.1 Supported Features
Remote data collection via TCP/IP
Remote data collection via ADB for the Android device
Target local data collection in a connectionless environment
Call Stack sampling data collection and corresponding data analysis
Hotspot sampling data collection and corresponding data analysis
Counter monitor data collection and corresponding data analysis.
Real-time counter monitor and post analysis
5.2.2 Unsupported Features
The software development kit (SDK) for dynamic code is not supported in this release.

5.3 System Requirements
This release supports the Marvell Code Performance Analyzer, version 2.3. Download this version from the Marvell Extranet website at http://www.marvell.com/extranet. If you do not have a Marvell Extranet user ID, click on the "register" link at http://www.marvell.com and follow the instructions therein.

5.4 Build, Install and Configuration
5.4.1 Install
Before running the data collector, go to the /system/bin/ folder and run the following command to load the kernel driver:
$ load_mpdc.sh

5.5 Known Issues or Limitations
It is recommended to first turn off the Marvell Scalable Power Management; otherwise, the Marvell Performance Data Collector (mpdc) may not work normally. Use the following commands to turn off the Marvell Scalable Power Management on your target.
echo 0 >/sys/power/mspm/mspm
When using the command line, if you get the error message "Fail to communicate with daemon:Success", reload your activity and run it to collect the result again.
When doing remote data collection on the Android target, if the analyzer exits abnormally, the status of the mpdc_svr may still be connected. If this happens, restart the mpdc_svr on the target.
If the samples/second value is set too large, the events/sample value is adjusted after a calibration to a smaller value, which makes the interrupt happen more frequently. If this happens, the system becomes busy and the mpdc stops after the expected duration is expired. In addition, most of the samples will be located on the process "mpdc_d". In this case, create your activity with a decreased samples/second value and start it. 
When using the command line, multiple activities cannot be started at the same time.
If you want to make mpdc_svr listen to another port through using the command "mpdc_svr -p <PortNumber>" on the Android target, a segmentation fault occurs.
Do not set OS_TIMER as the event in the Event-Based Sampling (EBS).
